# How do the versions work
The version number is has either "d", "t" or "r" appended.
### Suffix Key:
- "d" indicates that it's a developement build to which a debugger and profiler can be attached
- "t" indicates a test build, the included features may and likely will contain bugs, glitches and other issues
- "r" indicates a release build, meaning that all known bugs and glitches of that version should be fixed
- sometimes a numeral might be appended to the letter, this counts the number of patches applied within the version level and type
