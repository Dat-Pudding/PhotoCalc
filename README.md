## Who is this for?
This application is specifically for astro photographers - this doesn't mean that it's not useful for other genres.
Since a beginner usually isn't decked out with a tracking mount, means to create proper flats or a red flashlight, the android app is recommended for it's feature set specifically addressing these "hardware issues" for field-use. 

Not even more advanced amateurs might be able to say off-the-cuff which focal length they'd need to nicely fit their desired subject into the frame let alone beginners, that worry is also taken care of by the app.

### The bare minimum setup
For this app to be useful you'll need at least:
- some sort of camera
> *but phone sensor support is a bit tight as of now due to their size*
- some way to hold the camera still enough for the light frames

### The ideal setup
To fully profit of all functions you'll need:
- a system camera
- lenses (at least one)
- tripod (as rigid as possible)
- intervalometer

### Setups beyond
As soon as you add a tracker (and autoguider) to your setup the exposure time calculations will become less relevant if still relevant at all.
But even if you've outgrown most of its features the Field of View calculations can still help setting up the correct custom profiles in Stellarium (which by then you'll likely already own) or other similar apps that let you set specific viewports to pre-check your framing

## What can it do?
> ***NOTE:** There are differences in each version's capabilities and feature set, e.g. there's no need for field-use features on the desktop client*

Every version contains all formulae and accepts your setup's specifications as Inputs.
It will then proceed to present you the requested results.

As of now only the Android client offers a fully functional profile system, this feature will soon be implemented into the other versions as well. Of course it will be integrated into every ported client version too.

---

## What can each version do specifically?
### Desktop CLI
The CLI client was the very first iteration and features a basic menu system, by entering one of the shown options you'll get to the actual features.

It can calculate the longest exposure time for light frames with the wanted amount of star-trailing and will present the results of an approximational "Rule of 300", the old "Rule of 500" for reference as well as the simplified and the full NPF 
rules which both were developed by Frédéric Michaud from the Société Astronomique du Havre (SAH) - Thanks for the extraordinarily friendly permission to use them. 
After calculating it will give you the results in seconds (unit symbol: s ).

Also integrated is the capability to calculate the respective field of view along your sensor's (and thereby frame) short and long edge as well as the sensor's diagonal in relation to your focal length and sensor dimensions. 
These results will be presented in degrees (unit symbol: ° ).

### Desktop GUI
The GUI client can do everything the CLI client can do but puts a more comfortable user experience and less crude menu options in front of the maths instead of the CLI client's little black window.
Additionally the "Rule of 300" approximation is now a "Rule of your custom integer number" though 260 for full frame and 350 for APS-C crop cameras seem to be the most accurate ones that one can still easily memorise.

As of now you can already save sensor profiles but not read them in again, so in the near future you won't have to type in the dimensions each time you start the application.

### Mobile
The Android client is (for now) the only version meant for the use in the field. Additionally to the calculations it features a mostly red UI that serves as an red flashlight and a function to cast a solid white across the screen for taking flats, both of these special features work best when the phone's (or tablet's) screen is set to full brightness.

# Special Thanks
As mentioned before I want to thank especially Frédéric Michaud for permitting the use of his formulae.

And I also want to thank my fiancée Nina for enduring my constant oversharing on the project and for bringing snacks when I forgot to eat again
